Hi, there! Welcome to the Practical Accessibility course.

My name is Sara and I will be your instructor throughout this course.

I’ve been working at the intersection of design and engineering for a decade now, and I’ve been focusing on accessibility for more than half of that time now.

I’ve worked with designers and engineers of teams large and small, and I have helped companies create inclusive Web user interfaces for small micro-Websites, as well as full-fledged Web applications.

In this chapter, I want to give you a quick overview of what to expect in this course, and how to make your way through the chapters of the course.

If you're taking this course I assume you already know that accessibility is important, and that you want to learn what you need to learn to create Web sites and applications that are inclusive of people with disabilities.

The content of the course is very dense.

I dive straight into the technical and practical stuff. Knowledge you can take away and start applying right away.

## The chapters

The course alternates between chapters of theoretical nature and more practical chapters. The theoretical chapters are essential to your accessibility knowledge, and while they are theoretical in nature, they provide high practical value. They will will support you to get acquainted with various important topics, and will prepare you to actively dive into the world of accessible website development.

The first two chapters are a little “dry” compared to the rest of the chapters. We start with a chapter about what Web accessibility is, and how it is different from inclisivity and usability — all important concepts that will support your learning throughout the course. We will also learn about the various types of disabilities, and how people with disabilities access the Web.

In the second chapter, we learn all about the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, the Web standard for creating more accessible Web sites and applications. You will learn about and understand how WCAG is structured, and how to navigate your way through the standards. We will also cover the different documents that will help you understand and implement WCAG requirements in your projects.

In the third chapter, we will get an overview of accessibility testing tools and techniques. And then you will set up your accessibility development environment so that you can follow along and test your own work using the most poopular screen readers on both Mac and Windows.

After that, the chapters start to get more practical. We will start with learning about the accessibility tree and accessibility APIs — one of the most important pieces of accessibility knowledge you need. They are critical to udnerstanding how the code your write is presented to assistive technology users, and they provide you with invaluable insights about the accessibility of your work.

As we move through the course, you'll find that a non-trivial portion of accessibility work is to avoid breaking the inherent accessibility of the Web, and to use the built-in Web features the way they were meant to be used. This means that a critical requirement to building accessible Web products is to learn about the native features of the Web, starting with the foundations — HTML. So that’s what we’re going to do.

Will cover content gradually and in more depth as we move through the course. So you will hear a lot of <q>We will learn about this in more detail in another chapter</q>.

There will also be sentences, concepts and even entire sections that you will hear me repeat throughout many chapters. Important information deserves to be emphasized and re-iterated upon.

I created the chapters in a way that makes it easy for you to skip over some chapters and take the ones you're most interested in. In order to do that, I repeat some concepts or even some important sections of content across some chapters.

Even though chapters can be taken out of order, there is a rationale as to why I chose this specific order.

The table of contents / outline of each chapter gives you an overview of what the chapter will cover.

The Topics Covered includes what is essentially a glossary of the topics covered in each chapter. Don’t let any new words or concepts intimidate you. Even if a term is new to you, I’m confident that you will understand what it means by the end of each chapter.

## The accessibility toolkit

Throughout the chapters of the course, we will mention standards and specifications, as well as tools and resources that are helpful for your day-to-day accessibility work.

To make finding them easier, I collected the most useful documents and tools in the [Toolkit](/toolkit/) page. Think of this page as a bookmarks page.

There are many tools available on the Internet. Some of these tools are premium tools that you can purchase, others are free. To remove barriers to access, I will be focusing on free tools throughout the course that you can install and use in your work right away.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should ideally have HTML, CSS and just enough vanilla JavaScript knowledge. The course is framework-agnostic. We won't be using any JavaScript frameworks.

I used my strengths as a design engineer working at the intersection of design and engineering to create a balance between theoretical and technical content. Even technical concepts are relatively easy to follow for designers and anyone who doesn't have a technical background. To make the content of the course designer-friendly,

We will start wit theoretical concepts that have important and critical practical value.

I'll teach you technical knowledge you need to know to apply your decisions right. But the design and UX decisions still need work on your part, and lots of user testing.

There are many opinions. People will disagree. Make your decisions based on user testing, not ever-changing industry "best practices".

Keep in mind that support changes rapidly. I literally had to update the content of some chapters a couple of times while I was creating the content because testing has shown that support changed over the course of a few weeks.

You'll also find that, often, taking a progressive enhancement approach is a good way to develop more resilient and usable experiences for everyone. PE and a11y go hand in hand, and make for a great framework when developing a more inclusive Web.

We will focus on a11y techniques in this course that will help you achieve compliance, but I want you to think of everything you learn in this course as a means to an end. I want your end goal to be inclusivity, not just accessibility compliance.

Just like a doctor goes to medical school, learns fundamentals and techniques, etc. but the real work comes after he'd graduated, when he starts working with real patients. Similarly, this course will teach you a LOT of fundamentals and techniques that you can start applying _right away_; but the real work comes after the course, as you start designing and developing products for people, and you want to make sure the people you're doing this for can use your products. You'll want to talk to your users, and preferrably even include them in the design process as early as possible.

So, without further ado, let’s dive in!
