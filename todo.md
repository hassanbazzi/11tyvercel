Or on the flip side, bugs or unique heuristics could be introduced, which you may also need to be accounted for.

(Note: I'm not advocating for hacks that would create significant tech debt, or create a poor experience for when a bug is fixed. Rather I mean we should implement 'silent' work arounds that would have no impact were a bug to be rectified. Or implement a separate pattern/design that wouldn't cause an issue and possibly could have better UX anyway.) — Also, Scott from the same talk above

## Course intro, why you should take this course, what value it brings, "develop your topic into an argument— a clear point of view, the driving force of your book.

> What’s a problem that we haven’t yet found a good solution for? Or, what’s a solution that has been discarded but should be reconsidered?

• What’s a belief, practice, or habit in our industry that isn’t serving us (or our users) well? Why should we try to change it? Where do we start?

• What’s something about our work that seems to frustrate, confuse, or hold back our colleagues, stakeholders, or clients?

• Where do you see inequity, exclusion, or oppression in our industry? What do we need to change to make things better?

• What recent or upcoming changes in our industry (or in society) will require us to shift our thinking? Where do you see resistance? What can help overcome it?

> Answering these questions will help you develop your topic into an argument—that is, a clear point of view, the driving force of your book. Combine that argument with a few other ingredients—like a clear understanding of your audience, their challenges, and your industry context—and you’ll have built a strong foundation for your manuscript.

### Identify your audience

> You are writing for someone, so be as speciﬁc as possible about who that is. Go beyond “designers” or “people who want to know [thing my book is about].” Consider the roles, backgrounds, and skills your ideal reader might have, and what professional and personal contexts they might be operating in. This has a perfect corollary in web work: How often have you told a client or stakeholder, “The website’s audience can’t be ‘everyone’”? Same goes for you.

### Solve problems

You’re not just identifying who your audience is, but also what they want to do. Writing a professional text means you are writing to solve a professional problem your readers are dealing with—why else would they pick up your book?

We often see writers struggle to center their readers when they’re ﬁrst formulating their book ideas (and even well into drafting). We get it—it’s tough to approach your ideas from an external perspective, especially when you’re jazzed on writing and passionate about your topic. But readers aren’t in your head with you, and they don’t necessarily share your excitement; if they don’t immediately see how your book will beneﬁt them, they won’t Add to Cart.

> audiences want to discover something that will help them succeed, and your book needs to give them that.

> . But even if your book is more modular—say, the chapters can be read in any order, or readers are meant to jump in cold to the sections most relevant to their own work—you should still have some rationale for the order in which your ideas are presented.

> Later chapters continue the how in more granular detail, often looking to set the reader up for success: how to integrate new tactics into the reader’s workﬂow, how to convince stakeholders to support new design or development practices, or how to work with clients or team members in a new way. The ﬁnal chapter or conclusion may discuss the future of the topic, and revisit the why in a new light.

> Even if your topic is technical or academic, telling engaging, relatable stories can attract readers and keep them around long enough to learn something.

> “After we’ve ﬁnished presenting, how do we want our audience to be diﬀerent from when we started?”

> At minimum, you should include the source’s title, the author’s name, and a link to the original source, not only to provide credit but also to provide context and additional paths of research for your readers.

> what the reader can do right now to become a better web practitioner. This action-driven approach may not be true for every publisher or every style of book, but it’s never a bad idea to ask yourself what you want the reader to do with the information you’re presenting. Giving readers immediate, pragmatic recommendations will help them get as much value from your ideas as possible.

> Add segues. Segues—connecting material at the beginnings and endings of chapters and sections—help create narrative engagement, bridge ideas, set reader expectations, and reiterate key takeaways. These on- and oﬀ-ramps not only help you layer your lessons and improve ﬂow, but also help readers better understand the material.

Are your chapters and sections clearly divided and labeled?

• Did you write an introductory and concluding segue for each chapter?

• Do you have all the necessary links, references, and images in the document? If not, do you have placeholder text that will give your editors the information they need to assess those elements?

From Anna's book A11y for Designers:

> The word “disability” is not bad but instead describes a state of being that we may experience situationally, temporarily, or permanently, perhaps due to social or medical circumstances. [...] many of us benefit from accessible design, even when we don’t identify as having a disability.
> We all must do this because accessibility is a human right. Accessibility benefits every single human being on this planet, disabled and abled.
> It affects how people get jobs, food, homes, medical care, etc. It affects how we learn, how we play, and how we engage with each other. The need for accessibility is urgent, substantial, and constant. Our ability to make the web accessible is a matter of livelihood for disabled people and for everyone.
> We create inequity, and we disable people when we don’t design for accessibility.
> I don’t need to point to an “inspirational” story about someone with a disability because we all share too many experiences around disabilities and subsequently, accessibility. A singular story cannot capture that, and there are too many stories to choose from to rely on one alone to convince anyone.
> Every single story I’ve heard from users, peers, family, and friends has shown me that accessibility is not some “edge case''. Accessibility is core functionality, it’s a part of our job to make our experiences accessible.
> The truth is, I just think accessibility makes a lot of sense. I think it’s just good design. The need for accessibility is ubiquitous in all forms of design.
